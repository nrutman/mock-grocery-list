# mock-grocery-list
A mock Angular application that mimics a grocery list. This project is intended as an assessment tool and exercise when talking with other developers, and is not a legitimate application.

## Tasks to Complete
The following tasks should be completed to augment the application and progress through various development tasks.

### 1. Setup the Application
Clone the repository and run `npm start` to install the node dependencies and launch the embedded web server.

### 2. Hook Up a Dynamic List
Upon installation, the grocery list is completely static. Enable a dynamic list that stores multiple items and their associated data. This should include:

1. Dynamic data entry for a row in the list.
2. The ability to add as many rows as the user desires.
3. The ability to delete a row.
4. (Bonus!) The ability to rearrange rows via drag-and-drop.
